# Learning through public analytics competition
## Kaggle: Data Science for Good: CareerVillage.org

I may or may not be ready to create a solution, but the process of exploring the dataset and following community discussions on Kaggle is already valuable enough. 

### Step 1: EDA
I opted to do this via Power BI, due to its efficient built-in Relationship View, which helps visualize and connect different tables in our dataset.

NOTE: After trials and errors, I believe that I need to brush up on Machine Learning foundation through coursework, before continuing with this project. The competition was also over, so there is time to learn. I will continue with Step 2,3, and 4 after I complete the Machine Learning course from Andrew Ng.

### Step 2: Construct dataframes in Python 
### Step 3: Process/clean textual data
### Step 4: Create a predictive model
